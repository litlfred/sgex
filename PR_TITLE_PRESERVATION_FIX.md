# PR Title Preservation Fix

## Issue Summary
Users reported that AI/copilot agents were changing PR titles, which was undesired behavior. The original issue stated: "I don't want copilot to change the issue title text. once it has been created it should not be altered (unless there is existing functionality to show/change a status flag like [WIP] at the beginning of the title)."

## Root Cause
The problem was in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` which contained permissive language allowing title changes:

**Before (Problematic):**
```markdown
### Title Management
- **Preserve Original Intent**: Maintain the original issue title as much as possible, making improvements only for spelling, grammar, and clarity
```

This allowed copilots to modify title text for "improvements," which users didn't want.

## Solution
Updated the copilot instructions to be strict about title preservation:

**After (Fixed):**
```markdown
### Title Management
- **NEVER Change Title Text**: Once a PR title has been created, NEVER modify the core title text. The original title must be preserved exactly as written.
- **Status Tags Only**: The ONLY allowed changes are adding or updating status tags at the beginning of the title:
  - `[WIP]` - Work in Progress (while analysis/implementation is ongoing)
  - `[REVIEW]` - Ready for review by collaborators
  - `[BLOCKED]` - Waiting for input or dependencies
- **Status Tag Format**: If adding a status tag, use format: `[STATUS] Original Title Text` (preserve everything after the status tag exactly)
- **No Text Improvements**: Do NOT make spelling, grammar, or clarity improvements to the title text - preserve it exactly as originally written

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Changing PR title text (beyond status tags) is explicitly forbidden and will be flagged as incorrect behavior.
```

## What Changed

### 1. Strict Title Preservation
- Copilots can NO LONGER modify title text for any reason
- No spelling corrections, grammar fixes, or clarity improvements
- Original title text must be preserved exactly as written

### 2. Status Tags Only
- The ONLY allowed modification is adding/updating status tags like `[WIP]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[BLOCKED]`
- Status tags go at the beginning: `[STATUS] Original Title Text`
- Everything after the status tag must remain exactly the same

### 3. Updated Quality Checklist
The PR update checklist now enforces:
- Title text is NEVER changed - only status tags may be added/updated
- Original title text is preserved exactly (no spelling/grammar fixes)
- Status tags are used correctly if needed

### 4. Test Coverage
Added comprehensive test suite (`src/tests/prTitlePreservation.test.js`) that validates:
- Original titles are never changed
- Only status tag modifications are allowed
- Intentional typos/formatting are preserved
- Various edge cases are handled correctly

## Examples

### ✅ Allowed Changes
```
Original: "Fix broken authentication flow"
Allowed:  "[WIP] Fix broken authentication flow"
Allowed:  "[REVIEW] Fix broken authentication flow"
```

### ❌ Prohibited Changes
```
Original: "fix broken authentication flow"
Prohibited: "Fix Broken Authentication Flow" (capitalization)
Prohibited: "Fix broken auth flow" (word shortening)
Prohibited: "Fix broken authentication flow with improvements" (additions)
Prohibited: "Fix broken authentication workflow" (word changes)
```

## Impact
- Copilot agents will no longer modify PR titles beyond adding status tags
- Users can be confident their original title text will be preserved
- Status workflow ([WIP], [REVIEW], etc.) still functions as intended
- Existing PR titles are unaffected (this only affects future behavior)

## Testing
Run the test suite to verify the fix:
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=prTitlePreservation.test.js
```

All tests should pass, confirming that title preservation rules are working correctly.
