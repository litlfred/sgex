# Deployment Workflows

This repository uses two consolidated GitHub Actions workflows for deployment to GitHub Pages.

## üöÄ Branch Deployment (`branch-deployment.yml`)

**Purpose**: Deploy feature branches to subdirectories for preview purposes.

### Triggers
- **Manual only** (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Requires approval via GitHub environment protection

### Inputs
- `branch`: Branch to deploy (defaults to current branch)
- `force_deployment`: Force deployment even if no changes detected

### Behavior
- Deploys to `https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/{branch-name}/`
- Main branch deploys to `https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/main/`
- Branch names with slashes are converted to dashes (e.g., `feature/xyz` ‚Üí `feature-xyz`)
- **Never affects the root landing page**
- Preserves all other branch deployments
- Comments on associated PRs with preview URLs

### Safety Features
- Extensive path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Cannot deploy to repository root
- Validates branch names for safety
- Requires manual approval

## üè† Landing Page Deployment (`landing-page-deployment.yml`)

**Purpose**: Deploy the main application to the root of GitHub Pages.

### Triggers
- **Manual only** (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Requires approval via GitHub environment protection

### Inputs
- `source_branch`: Branch to deploy from (defaults to `main`)
- `force_deployment`: Force deployment even if no changes detected

### Behavior
- Deploys to `https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/`
- **Never affects branch subdirectories**
- Preserves all existing branch deployments
- Only updates root-level files

### Safety Features
- Only removes specific root-level files
- Never removes directories (preserves all branch deployments)
- Requires manual approval

## üîí Security & Approval Process

### Manual Deployment
Both main workflows are manually triggered (`workflow_dispatch`) and require user confirmation:
1. Navigate to Actions tab
2. Select the appropriate workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" and confirm parameters
4. Workflows will execute immediately upon confirmation

### PR Review Deployment
The `review.yml` workflow automatically triggers when a PR is approved:
1. When a PR receives an approved review, the workflow runs automatically
2. It posts a comment with a deployment link for eligible branches
3. Branches `gh-pages` and `deploy` are excluded from review-triggered deployments
4. The actual deployment still requires manual confirmation via the deployment link

**Note**: Environment protection was removed to resolve deployment issues while maintaining manual trigger control.

## üìã Workflow Files

### Active Workflows
- `branch-deployment.yml` - Branch previews deployment (manual trigger + workflow_call)
- `landing-page-deployment.yml` - Landing page deployment (manual trigger)
- `review.yml` - PR review-triggered deployment suggestions (automatic on approval)
- `framework-compliance.yml` - Compliance checks (automatic on PR)

### Removed Workflows
The following workflows were consolidated and removed:
- `deploy-branch-selector.yml` - Replaced by `landing-page-deployment.yml`
- `landing-page-deploy.yml` - Replaced by `landing-page-deployment.yml`
- `pages.yml` - Replaced by `branch-deployment.yml`

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Both workflows include:
- Build validation with TypeScript type checking
- JSON schema generation and validation
- Path safety checks
- Commit verification
- Rollback capabilities

### TypeScript Integration

The deployment process now includes TypeScript-specific steps:

#### Type Checking
All deployments perform TypeScript type checking before building:
```yaml
- name: Type Check
  run: npm run type-check
```

#### Schema Generation
JSON schemas are automatically generated from TypeScript types during the build process:
```yaml
- name: Generate Schemas
  run: npm run generate-schemas
```

This ensures that:
- Type definitions are validated before deployment
- JSON schemas are always up-to-date with TypeScript types
- Runtime validation schemas are available in the deployed application

#### Build Process
The updated build process includes:
1. Install dependencies
2. TypeScript type checking
3. JSON schema generation from TypeScript types
4. React application build
5. Deployment artifact creation

Generated schemas are published to `public/docs/schemas/` and include:
- `generated-schemas-tjs.json` - Schemas from typescript-json-schema
- `generated-schemas-tsjsg.json` - Schemas from ts-json-schema-generator
- Individual type schemas for runtime validation

### Build Failure Handling

If TypeScript type checking fails:
- The deployment stops immediately
- Error messages show specific type errors
- No artifacts are deployed
- The team is notified of type issues

This ensures that only type-safe code reaches production environments.

## üìù Usage Examples

### Deploy a feature branch for preview:
**Option 1: From an approved PR**
1. Get your PR approved by a reviewer
2. The system will automatically post a deployment comment with a direct link
3. Click the deployment link in the comment
4. Click "Run workflow" and confirm

**Option 2: Manual deployment**
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Deploy Feature Branch"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter branch name (or leave empty for current branch)
4. Wait for deployment

### Update the landing page:
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Deploy Landing Page"  
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Choose source branch (defaults to main)
4. Wait for approval and deployment

## üéØ Benefits

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Branch previews vs. landing page
- **Safety first**: Extensive validation prevents accidents
- **Manual control**: All deployments require explicit approval
- **Preserves work**: No deployment affects other deployments
- **Simple interface**: Easy-to-use workflow inputs
- **Comprehensive feedback**: PR comments and deployment summaries
