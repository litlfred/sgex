# Fix for Issue #883: Always Build Pages

## Summary

Successfully implemented the requirement to run the Deploy Feature Branch workflow "on any commit to a branch that is not gh-pages".

## Problem

The workflow was previously configured to exclude multiple branches:
```yaml
push:
  branches-ignore: [gh-pages, deploy, main]
```

This meant the workflow would NOT trigger on commits to `main` and `deploy` branches, only on feature branches.

## Solution

Changed the configuration to only exclude the `gh-pages` branch:
```yaml
push:
  branches-ignore: [gh-pages]
```

## Impact

### Before the Change:
- ❌ Main branch commits: No automatic deployment
- ❌ Deploy branch commits: No automatic deployment  
- ✅ Feature branch commits: Automatic deployment
- ❌ gh-pages branch commits: No deployment (correct)

### After the Change:
- ✅ Main branch commits: Automatic deployment (with environment approval)
- ✅ Deploy branch commits: Automatic deployment (with environment approval)
- ✅ Feature branch commits: Automatic deployment
- ❌ gh-pages branch commits: No deployment (correct)

## Safety Mechanisms Maintained

The change preserves all existing safety mechanisms:
- **Environment Approval**: Main branch deployments still require approval via the `production-pages` environment
- **Path Filtering**: Only relevant file changes trigger deployment
- **Concurrency Control**: Branch-specific concurrency groups prevent conflicts
- **Manual Override**: Manual triggers still available for all workflows

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/branch-deployment.yml`**: Updated trigger configuration
2. **`src/tests/BranchDeploymentWorkflowTriggers.test.js`**: Updated test expectations
3. **`src/tests/WorkflowAutomationTriggers.test.js`**: Updated test expectations  
4. **`DEPLOYMENT.md`**: Updated documentation
5. **`src/tests/AlwaysBuildPages.test.js`**: Added verification test

## Verification

All tests pass, confirming:
- ✅ Workflow triggers on any branch except gh-pages
- ✅ YAML configuration is valid
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality
- ✅ Documentation is updated
- ✅ Test coverage is complete

## Example Scenarios

The workflow will now trigger automatically on:
- Push to `main` branch → Deploy with approval required
- Push to `deploy` branch → Deploy with approval required
- Push to `feature/new-component` → Deploy to preview (no approval)
- Push to `release/v1.0` → Deploy to preview (no approval)

The workflow will NOT trigger on:
- Push to `gh-pages` branch → Prevents deployment conflicts

This change enables continuous deployment for all development branches while maintaining production safety controls.
