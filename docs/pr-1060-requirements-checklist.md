This document verifies that all requirements from PR #1060 comments have been implemented.

## Requirements from PR #1060 Comments

### 1. Same Comment Updated Throughout Build Process ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "I want that the same comment is updated throughout each stage of the build and deploy process"

**Implementation**: 
- Uses action-specific HTML marker: `<!-- sgex-deployment-status-comment:ACTION_ID -->`
- `get_existing_comment()` finds comment by marker
- `update_comment()` updates existing comment or creates new one
- Exactly one comment per workflow run (action_id)

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

### 2. Python Script with Content Injection Protection ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "all comment management functionality should be in a python script rather in GitHub workflow and be properly protected against content injection"

**Implementation**:
- All logic in `scripts/manage-pr-comment.py`
- `sanitize_string()` - removes control characters, limits length, escapes markdown
- `sanitize_url()` - only allows https URLs to github.com and github.io domains
- `validate_stage()` - validates stage names against whitelist
- Input validation on all user-provided data

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

### 3. Works with Workflow Triggers ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "the script should work if the workflow is run from either the PR 'Approve workflows to run' or on workflow_dispatch form GitHub Actions UI"

**Implementation**:
- Uses `github.run_id` as action_id (automatically set by GitHub)
- Finds PR from branch name via `find_pr` step
- Works with manual dispatch, PR events, and push events
- Action ID ensures consistent marker across all calls

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

### 4. Timeline with Timestamps ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "can you edit the existing comment not by overwriting the comment but appending to the existing comment so people get a sense of the timeline. add timestamp to each update"

**Implementation**:
- `extract_timeline_from_comment()` preserves existing timeline
- Each update adds new timeline entry with UTC timestamp
- Timeline grows chronologically
- Format: `- **2025-10-06 19:35:42 UTC** - üîµ Build started for commit [abc123](...)`

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

### 5. Next Step Indicator ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "add timestamp to each update and say what next step is"

**Implementation**:
Each stage includes next step:
- started: "**Next:** Installing dependencies and setting up environment"
- setup: "**Next:** Building React application"
- building: "**Next:** Deploying to GitHub Pages"
- deploying: "**Next:** Verifying deployment accessibility"
- verifying: "**Next:** Deployment complete or failure reported"
- success: "**Status:** Deployment complete - site is ready for testing"

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

### 6. Styled Buttons ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "I would expected to see the expected deployment URL to be updated as a 'quick link' using the orange button styling while in progress, turn to green button styling on success, red on failure. I expect the build logs under the quick links to use the grey button styling."

**Implementation**:
- **Build Logs**: Gray button (all stages)
  ```html
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Build_Logs-gray?style=for-the-badge&logo=github" />
  ```
- **Preview URL**: Orange button (building, deploying, verifying)
  ```html
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Preview_URL-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&label=üåê&labelColor=gray" />
  ```
- **Preview URL**: Green button (success, pages-built)
  ```html
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_Branch_Preview-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&label=üåê&labelColor=gray" />
  ```
- **Error Logs**: Red button (failure)
  ```html
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Error_Logs-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&label=üìä&labelColor=gray" />
  ```

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Fixed in commit 8548c02 - URL sanitization now allows github.io)

---

### 7. Build Log Links with Action ID ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "message ‚ùó Check build logs and fix issues before retrying deployment. should have link to appropriate build log by the action id"

**Implementation**:
- All stages include workflow_url link to build logs
- Failure stage includes: `_Action ID: {action_id}_` for easy reference
- Links directly to the specific workflow run

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

### 8. Expected Deployment URL Visible Early ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "as part of the update PR comment - building application, I would expected to see the expected deployment URL"

**Implementation**:
- Branch URL calculated during "Building Application" step
- Orange "Preview URL" button shown in building, deploying, verifying stages
- Includes helpful text: "_(will be live after deployment)_" or "_(deploying...)_" or "_(verifying...)_"
- Turns green on success/pages-built

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Fixed in commit 8548c02 - URL sanitization now allows github.io)

---

### 9. Exactly One Comment Per Action ID ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "I want to make sure that there is exactly one comment per action id"

**Implementation**:
- Action-specific marker: `<!-- sgex-deployment-status-comment:ACTION_ID -->`
- `get_existing_comment()` searches for this exact marker
- If found: updates existing comment
- If not found: creates new comment with marker
- Different action IDs create separate comments (e.g., deploy-branch vs pages-build-deployment)

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

### 10. Multi-Workflow Support ‚úÖ
**Comment**: "can you also describe the interaction between those two workflows and how they can share a common comment to update (e.g. through an optional build variable)"

**Implementation**:
- Documented in `WORKFLOW_INTERACTION.md`
- deploy-branch uses `github.run_id` as action_id
- pages-build-deployment uses `github.event.deployment.id` as action_id
- Each workflow maintains its own comment
- Action ID passed via `--action-id` parameter

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED and DOCUMENTED
