# MCP Upstream Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have analyzed the current DAK FAQ "MCP" service and implemented upstream improvements to align with the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification. The current implementation was actually a custom REST API server, not a true MCP implementation.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Official MCP SDK Integration**
- Added `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.17.4` dependency
- Implemented proper JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol compliance
- Added Zod schema validation for type safety

### 2. **True MCP Server Implementation**
- **New File**: `services/dak-faq-mcp/mcp-server.ts`
- Implements standardized MCP message patterns:
  - `initialize` with capabilities negotiation
  - `tools/list` for tool discovery
  - `tools/call` for tool execution
- Uses stdio transport for CLI integration
- Proper error handling with MCP-compliant responses

### 3. **MCP Tools Provided**
- **`execute_faq_question`**: Execute specific DAK FAQ questions with structured results
- **`list_faq_questions`**: List available questions with filtering options
- **`get_question_schema`**: Get JSON schema for question parameters

### 4. **Enhanced Build System**
- New npm scripts: `start-mcp`, `dev-mcp`, `run-mcp-server`
- Updated main project scripts to support MCP builds
- Integrated MCP server into documentation generation

### 5. **Standards Compliance**
- Proper MCP capabilities negotiation
- Standard tool definitions with JSON schemas
- MCP-compliant error responses
- Structured content responses with type safety

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Custom REST API)
```
Express.js Server (Port 3001)
├── GET /health
├── GET /faq/questions/catalog
├── POST /faq/questions/execute
└── Custom error handling
```

### After (Hybrid: REST + MCP)
```
Express.js Server (Port 3001)     MCP Server (stdio)
├── REST endpoints (unchanged)     ├── JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
├── Backward compatibility        ├── tools/list
└── HTTP transport                ├── tools/call
                                  └── Standard MCP transport
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Standards Compliance**
- Now follows official MCP specification
- Compatible with MCP-aware clients and tools
- Future-proof architecture

### 2. **Enhanced Integration**
- CLI integration via stdio transport
- Standardized tool discovery
- Better error handling

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing REST API unchanged
- Gradual migration path available
- No breaking changes to current users

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Better TypeScript support with Zod schemas
- Comprehensive error messages
- Self-documenting tool definitions

## Usage Examples

### MCP Client Integration
```bash
# Start MCP server
npm run run-mcp-server

# Example MCP tool call (via stdio)
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "execute_faq_question",
    "arguments": {
      "questionId": "dak-name",
      "context": {
        "repositoryPath": "/path/to/dak"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### REST API (Unchanged)
```bash
# Still works as before
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/faq/questions/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"requests": [{"questionId": "dak-name"}]}'
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: ✅ **Completed - Foundation**
- Added official MCP SDK
- Implemented basic MCP server
- Created stdio transport
- Maintained REST compatibility

### Phase 2: **Next Steps**
- Add HTTP transport for MCP
- Enhance tool schemas
- Add resource endpoints
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: **Future**
- WebSocket transport
- Advanced MCP features
- REST deprecation (long-term)
- Enhanced client libraries

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Dependencies
```json
{
  "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.17.4",
  "zod": "^3.25.76"
}
```

### New Files Added
- `services/dak-faq-mcp/mcp-server.ts` - Main MCP server implementation
- `services/dak-faq-mcp/server/storage/LocalStorageImpl.ts` - File system storage

### Updated Files
- `services/dak-faq-mcp/package.json` - Added MCP scripts and dependencies
- `package.json` - Added MCP build and run scripts

## Testing and Validation

### Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ MCP server starts correctly
- ✅ Tool listing functional
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### Recommended Testing
```bash
# Build and test MCP functionality
npm run build-mcp
npm run run-mcp-server

# Test tool discovery and execution
# (Requires MCP client for full testing)
```

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Benefits
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing REST API unchanged
- **Standards Alignment**: Now follows official MCP protocol
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: CLI integration and standardized tools

### Long-term Benefits
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Compatible with MCP tooling
- **Future Proofing**: Aligned with MCP evolution
- **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and documentation

## Conclusion

The DAK FAQ service has been successfully upgraded from a custom REST API to a hybrid system that supports both REST (for backward compatibility) and proper MCP protocol (for standards compliance and enhanced capabilities). This provides the best of both worlds while positioning the service for future MCP ecosystem integration.

The implementation demonstrates how to properly adopt MCP standards while maintaining practical usability and backward compatibility.
