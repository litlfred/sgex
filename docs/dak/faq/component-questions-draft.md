## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (High Priority)
1. Decision-Support Logic: `decision-table-rules`, `decision-dependencies`
2. Core Data Elements: `terminology-coverage`, `data-constraints`
3. Program Indicators: `indicator-calculations`, `indicator-targets`

### Phase 2 (Medium Priority)
1. Business Processes: `process-participants`, `process-decision-points`
2. Generic Personas: `actor-roles`, `actor-workflows`
3. Test Scenarios: `test-coverage`, `test-data-requirements`

### Phase 3 (Lower Priority)
1. Health Interventions: `publication-references`, `guideline-sections`
2. User Scenarios: `scenario-steps`, `scenario-actors`
3. Requirements: `requirement-categories`, `requirement-traceability`

## Technical Considerations

### File Type Support
- **Text-based assets**: Markdown, YAML, JSON, XML parsing
- **Binary assets**: PDF parsing (limited), image metadata extraction
- **Structured formats**: DMN, BPMN, FHIR JSON/XML

### Cross-component Questions
Some questions span multiple components:
- "Which decisions reference this data element?"
- "What test scenarios validate this business process?"
- "Which indicators measure this intervention outcome?"

### Internationalization
All questions should support the existing locale framework:
- en_US, fr_FR, es_ES, ar_AR, zh_CN, ru_RU
- Narrative responses in multiple languages
- Error messages and warnings localized

### Caching Strategy
- File-level caching for individual asset analysis
- Component-level caching for cross-file relationships
- Repository-level caching for summary statistics
