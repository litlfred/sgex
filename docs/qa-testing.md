# QA Testing Documentation

## Overview

The SGEX Workbench includes a comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) testing system that automatically generates detailed reports on code quality, test coverage, and system reliability.

## Accessing the QA Report

The QA report is automatically generated during the CI/CD pipeline and is available on the deployed site at: **[/docs/qa-report.html](/docs/qa-report.html)**

> **Note**: The QA report is generated dynamically during deployment and is not committed to the repository to prevent infinite loops in the CI/CD pipeline. The report is always available on the live site after successful deployment.

## Report Generation Process

1. **Automated Generation**: The QA report is generated on every push to the main branch or pull request
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Generated as part of the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`)
3. **Deployment Only**: The report files are created during build time and deployed to GitHub Pages but not committed to the repository
4. **Path Exclusion**: The workflow uses `paths-ignore` to prevent triggering when generated files would be committed

## What's Included in the QA Report

### ðŸ“Š Test Execution Summary
- **Total Tests**: Complete count of all automated tests
- **Passed Tests**: Number of tests that executed successfully
- **Failed Tests**: Number of tests that encountered issues
- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests that passed successfully

### ðŸ“ˆ Code Coverage Analysis
The report provides detailed code coverage metrics including:
- **Statements Coverage**: Percentage of code statements executed during testing
- **Branches Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches tested
- **Functions Coverage**: Percentage of functions called during testing
- **Lines Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed

### ðŸ§ª Test File Breakdown
Detailed breakdown of each test file showing:
- Test file name and status
- Number of individual tests per file
- Pass/fail status for each test file

### ðŸ’¡ Quality Recommendations
Automated recommendations for improving code quality based on:
- Coverage thresholds
- Test reliability metrics
- WHO SMART Guidelines compliance standards

## Testing Philosophy

### WHO SMART Guidelines Compliance
All tests are designed to validate compliance with WHO SMART Guidelines standards, ensuring:
- Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) component integrity
- FHIR resource validation
- Business process workflow compliance
- Data quality and consistency

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests
- Component functionality testing
- Service layer validation
- Utility function verification

#### Integration Tests
- GitHub API integration testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Cross-component interaction testing

#### UI/UX Tests
- User interface component testing
- Accessibility compliance validation
- Cross-browser compatibility checks

## Continuous Quality Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Integration
The QA report generation is integrated into our GitHub Actions workflow:
1. **Triggered**: On every push to main branch and pull requests
2. **Execution**: Runs complete test suite with coverage analysis
3. **Generation**: Creates styled HTML report matching SGEX design
4. **Deployment**: Automatically published to GitHub Pages documentation

### Report Styling
The QA report follows the same design standards as the main SGEX application:
- WHO SMART Guidelines branding
- Consistent blue gradient background (`#0078d4` to `#005a9e`)
- Accessible typography and color contrast
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Understanding Test Results

### Coverage Thresholds
We aim for the following minimum coverage levels:
- **Statements**: 80% or higher
- **Branches**: 70% or higher
- **Functions**: 75% or higher
- **Lines**: 80% or higher

### Test Reliability
- **Pass Rate Target**: 95% or higher
- **Zero Tolerance**: Critical functionality must have 100% passing tests
- **Performance**: Tests should complete within reasonable time limits

## Contributing to Test Quality

### Adding New Tests
When contributing new features:
1. Write tests for new functionality
2. Ensure tests follow existing patterns
3. Verify tests pass locally before submitting PR
4. Update test documentation as needed

### Test File Locations
- **Unit Tests**: `src/tests/`
- **Integration Tests**: `src/tests/`
- **Test Utilities**: `src/utils/`
- **Test Configuration**: `package.json` Jest configuration

### Best Practices
- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain test independence (no test should depend on another)

## Issue Analysis and Test Planning

### GitHub Issues Review Process
As part of our QA process, we regularly review:
- Pull requests for potential bug sources
- Issue reports for testing opportunities
- Code changes that might require additional test coverage

### Test Plan Development
For each identified potential issue:
1. **Relevance Check**: Verify the functionality still exists in current code
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the potential impact of the issue
3. **Test Design**: Create specific tests to prevent the issue
4. **Implementation**: Add tests to the appropriate test suite

## Automated Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Validation
Before any deployment:
- All tests must pass
- Coverage must meet minimum thresholds
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks must be met

### Continuous Monitoring
- Daily automated test runs
- Weekly comprehensive quality reports
- Monthly test suite review and optimization
