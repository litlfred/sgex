# Requirements Editor Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements Editor component for the SGEX Workbench DAK Dashboard, addressing GitHub issue requirements to align with WHO smart-base requirement models.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE (Pending Route Configuration)

The RequirementsEditor component is fully implemented and ready for use. The only remaining step is route configuration approval (see REQUIREMENTS_EDITOR_ROUTE_CONFIG_REQUEST.md).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. RequirementsEditor Component (`src/components/RequirementsEditor.js`)

A full-featured React component for managing functional and non-functional requirements:

#### Core Features
- **List View**: Displays all FSH requirement files from `input/fsh/requirements/`
- **Create Functional Requirements**: WHO-compliant template with fields:
  - `id`: Requirement identifier
  - `activity`: Activity description
  - `actor`: Actor references
  - `capability`: "I want" capability statement
  - `benefit`: "So that" benefit statement
  - `classification`: Classification codes

- **Create Non-Functional Requirements**: WHO-compliant template with fields:
  - `id`: Requirement identifier
  - `requirement`: Requirement description
  - `category`: Category (performance, security, usability, etc.)
  - `classification`: Classification codes

- **Edit Requirements**: FSH content editor with real-time editing
- **Delete Requirements**: Safe deletion with confirmation dialog
- **Help Integration**: Contextual help via ContextualHelpMascot

#### Technical Implementation
- Uses PageLayout and AssetEditorLayout framework components
- Integrates with githubService for file operations
- Supports URL-based navigation pattern: `/{component}/{user}/{repo}/{branch}`
- Responsive layout with sidebar list and main editor panel
- Accessibility-compliant with keyboard navigation

### 2. RequirementsEditor Styling (`src/components/RequirementsEditor.css`)

Complete CSS implementation matching SGEX design patterns:
- Blue gradient background matching DAK Dashboard
- Two-column layout (sidebar + editor)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Professional FSH editor styling
- Consistent button and interaction states

### 3. Component Route Service Update (`src/services/componentRouteService.js`)

Added lazy loading case for RequirementsEditor:
```javascript
case 'RequirementsEditor':
  LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('../components/RequirementsEditor'));
  break;
```

### 4. Help Content (`src/services/helpContentService.js`)

Comprehensive help topics added:
- **Requirements Editor Overview**: Introduction and overview
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed field explanations
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Category and field guide
- **Creating Requirements**: Step-by-step creation guide
- **Editing Requirements**: Editing workflow
- **WHO SMART Base Requirements Models**: Model references and links
- **Requirements Extraction**: Information about req_extractor.py

### 5. Documentation Updates (`public/docs/dak-components.md`)

Enhanced section 8 (Functional and Non-Functional Requirements) with:
- Editor description and capabilities
- File location information
- Model definitions (FunctionalRequirement and NonFunctionalRequirement)
- Reference to WHO smart-base extraction tool

## WHO SMART Guidelines Compliance

### Authoritative Source

The implementation is based on the authoritative WHO smart-base logical models at:
- https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/tree/main/input/fsh/models

### FunctionalRequirement Model

```fsh
Logical:       FunctionalRequirement
Title:         "Functional Requirement (DAK)"
Description:   "Logical Model for representing functional requirement from a DAK"

* ^status = #active
* id 1..1 id "Requirement ID"
* activity 1..1 string "Activity"
* actor 0..* Reference(SGActor) "Actor"
* capability[x] 0..1 string or Coding "Capability"
* benefit[x] 0..1 string or Coding "Benefit"
* classification 0..* Coding "Classification"
```

### NonFunctionalRequirement Model

```fsh
Logical:       NonFunctionalRequirement
Title:         "Non-Functional Requirement (DAK)"
Description:   "Logical Model for representing non-functional requirement from a DAK"

* ^status = #active
* id 1..1 id "Requirement ID"
* requirement 1..1 string "Requirement"
* category 0..1 Coding "Category"
* classification 0..* Coding "Classification"
```

### req_extractor.py Integration

The component is designed to work alongside WHO smart-base's `req_extractor.py` script:
- Script location: `input/scripts/req_extractor.py`
- Processes Excel files from `input/system-requirements/`
- Extracts requirements from "Functional" and "Non-Functional" worksheets
- Generates FHIR Requirements resources

The RequirementsEditor provides a complementary FSH-based workflow for manual requirement creation and editing.

## File Organization

### Requirements Storage
- **Location**: `input/fsh/requirements/`
- **Format**: `.fsh` files (FHIR Shorthand)
- **Naming Convention**: Descriptive names with type prefix
  - Example: `FunctionalRequirement-FR001.fsh`
  - Example: `NonFunctionalRequirement-NFR001.fsh`

### Template Generation

The component generates WHO-compliant FSH templates:

**Functional Requirement Template:**
```fsh
Logical: NewFunctionalRequirement
Title: "New Functional Requirement"
Description: "Description of the functional requirement"
Parent: FunctionalRequirement

* id = "FR-NEW-001"
* activity = "Description of the activity being performed"
* actor = Reference(ActorName) // Optional: Reference to actor
* capability = "I want to..." // Optional: Capability statement
* benefit = "So that..." // Optional: Benefit statement
* classification = #category // Optional: Classification code
```

**Non-Functional Requirement Template:**
```fsh
Logical: NewNonFunctionalRequirement
Title: "New Non-Functional Requirement"
Description: "Description of the non-functional requirement"
Parent: NonFunctionalRequirement

* id = "NFR-NEW-001"
* requirement = "Description of the non-functional requirement"
* category = #performance // Optional: Category
* classification = #category // Optional: Classification code
```

## User Workflow

### Creating a Functional Requirement
1. Navigate to Requirements Editor from DAK Dashboard
2. Click "+ Functional" button
3. Edit the template with requirement details
4. Save to commit to GitHub repository

### Creating a Non-Functional Requirement
1. Navigate to Requirements Editor from DAK Dashboard
2. Click "+ Non-Functional" button
3. Edit the template with requirement details
4. Save to commit to GitHub repository

### Editing an Existing Requirement
1. Select requirement from sidebar list
2. FSH content loads in editor
3. Make changes to FSH content
4. Save to commit changes

### Deleting a Requirement
1. Select requirement from sidebar list
2. Click "Delete" button
3. Confirm deletion
4. File is removed from repository

## Integration with DAK Dashboard

The DAK Dashboard already includes the requirements component:

```javascript
{
  id: 'functional-requirements',
  title: 'Functional and Non-Functional Requirements',
  description: 'System requirements specifications that define capabilities and constraints',
  icon: '⚙️',
  path: 'functional-requirements',
  level: 'Level 2: Core Components',
  color: '#6b69d6'
}
```

## Pending Items

### Route Configuration (BLOCKED - Requires Approval)

The file `public/routes-config.json` requires the following entry:

```json
"functional-requirements": {
  "component": "RequirementsEditor",
  "path": "./components/RequirementsEditor"
}
```

**Status**: Awaiting approval from @litlfred (file is protected)

**Documentation**: See REQUIREMENTS_EDITOR_ROUTE_CONFIG_REQUEST.md

### Testing (DEFERRED - Pending Route Configuration)

Testing cannot be completed until route configuration is approved because:
- Component cannot be accessed via URL
- Dashboard navigation to component won't work
- GitHub integration cannot be validated

**Planned Tests** (once route is configured):
1. Basic access and loading
2. Create functional requirement
3. Create non-functional requirement
4. Edit existing requirement
5. Delete requirement
6. FSH template validation
7. GitHub file operations

## Build Status

### ✅ Compilation
- Component compiles successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- No critical warnings

### ⚠️ Warnings

## Minimal Changes Principle

This implementation follows the "minimal changes" principle:
1. **Single new component**: Only RequirementsEditor added
2. **Pattern consistency**: Follows existing QuestionnaireEditor pattern
3. **Framework compliance**: Uses existing PageLayout and AssetEditorLayout
4. **No breaking changes**: All changes are additive
5. **Documentation only**: Updates only related documentation
