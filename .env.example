# GitHub Personal Access Token Configuration
#
# SGEX Workbench uses GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for authentication.
# No environment configuration is required - the app will guide users through
# creating their own Personal Access Tokens when they first sign in.
#
# The application provides built-in instructions for:
# 1. Creating fine-grained or classic Personal Access Tokens
# 2. Setting the correct permissions (Contents, Metadata, Pull requests)
# 3. Securely entering the token into the application
#
# Personal Access Tokens are stored securely in the user's browser and
# never need to be included in environment files or committed to repositories.
#
# For more information, see the in-app PAT setup instructions.
