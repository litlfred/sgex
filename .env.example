# OAuth Client Configuration

# For GitHub OAuth Device Flow to work, you need to register an OAuth app with GitHub.
# 
# Steps to register:
# 1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps
# 2. Click "New OAuth App"
# 3. Fill in:
#    - Application name: "SGEX Workbench"
#    - Homepage URL: Your deployment URL (e.g., https://litlfred.github.io/sgex)
#    - Authorization callback URL: Your deployment URL (required but not used in device flow)
# 4. After creating, copy the Client ID
# 5. Set the REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID environment variable or update src/config/oauth.js

# The Client ID is safe to include in client-side code as it's designed to be public.
# Client secrets are NOT needed or used in device flow.

# Example environment variable (for production):
# REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.your_actual_client_id_here

# Development placeholder (won't work for actual OAuth):
REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98
