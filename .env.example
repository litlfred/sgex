# GitHub Authentication Configuration
#
# SGEX Workbench supports two authentication methods:
#
# 1. GitHub OAuth Device Flow (Recommended)
# 2. GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) - Fallback
#
# OAuth Device Flow Configuration (Optional but Recommended):
# REACT_APP_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_app_client_id_here
#
# If OAuth is configured, users will see an OAuth login option that provides:
# - Higher rate limits (5000 requests/hour vs 60 for unauthenticated)
# - Seamless authentication without manual token creation
# - Better user experience with standard OAuth flow
#
# OAuth setup instructions:
# 1. Create a GitHub OAuth App at https://github.com/settings/applications/new
# 2. Set "Authorization callback URL" to any value (not used in Device Flow)
# 3. Copy the "Client ID" and set it as REACT_APP_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
# 4. Leave "Client Secret" secure - it's not needed for Device Flow
#
# Personal Access Token Fallback:
# If OAuth is not configured, the app will guide users through creating
# their own Personal Access Tokens with built-in instructions for:
# 1. Creating fine-grained or classic Personal Access Tokens
# 2. Setting the correct permissions (Contents, Metadata, Pull requests)
# 3. Securely entering the token into the application
#
# All authentication tokens are stored securely in the user's browser using
# XOR encryption and never need to be included in environment files.
