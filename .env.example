# GitHub Authentication Configuration
#
# SGEX Workbench supports both Personal Access Tokens (PATs) and OAuth authentication.
# No environment configuration is required for basic functionality - the app will guide
# users through authentication when they first sign in.
#
# OAuth Configuration (Recommended)
# For OAuth authentication, you can optionally set:
# REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-app-client-id
#
# If not set, defaults to 'sgex-workbench-dev' for development.
# Create a GitHub App at https://github.com/settings/apps with:
# - Device Flow enabled
# - Appropriate OAuth scopes (read:user, public_repo, repo)
#
# Personal Access Token (PAT) Configuration (Legacy)
# The application provides built-in instructions for:
# 1. Creating fine-grained or classic Personal Access Tokens
# 2. Setting the correct permissions (Contents, Metadata, Pull requests)
# 3. Securely entering the token into the application
#
# Personal Access Tokens are stored securely in the user's browser and
# never need to be included in environment files or committed to repositories.
#
# For development setup with OAuth, see docs/development-oauth-setup.md
