# GitHub OAuth Configuration
#
# SGEX Workbench uses GitHub App OAuth for secure authentication.
# A GitHub App Client ID is REQUIRED for OAuth functionality.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Create a GitHub App at https://github.com/settings/apps
# 2. Enable Device Flow in your GitHub App settings
# 3. Copy your GitHub App's Client ID
# 4. Create a .env.local file with your Client ID:
#
# REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.your-actual-client-id-here
#
# Required OAuth Scopes:
# - read:user (for user information)
# - public_repo (for read access to public repositories)
# - repo (for full repository access when write permissions are needed)
#
# For detailed setup instructions, see:
# - docs/github-app-setup.md (GitHub App creation)
# - docs/development-oauth-setup.md (local development setup)
