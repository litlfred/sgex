# PAT Token Loss Investigation - Document Index

This directory contains a comprehensive investigation into the PAT (Personal Access Token) disappearance issue reported for SGeX Workbench.

## Investigation Documents

### üìä [PAT_TOKEN_LOSS_INVESTIGATION.md](./PAT_TOKEN_LOSS_INVESTIGATION.md)
**Main investigation report with findings and recommendations**

**Contents**:
- Token storage architecture analysis
- 7 potential scenarios for token loss (ranked by likelihood)
- Evidence and impact assessment for each scenario
- Browser behavior analysis (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Testing recommendations
- Summary of likely causes in priority order

**Key Finding**: Browser fingerprint sensitivity and sessionStorage limitations are the most likely causes, with window resize, zoom changes, and new tab openings being primary triggers.

### üîç [PAT_TOKEN_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md](./PAT_TOKEN_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md)
**Practical debugging guide for users and support teams**

**Contents**:
- Quick debugging steps using browser console
- Console log message signatures for each scenario
- 8 detailed scenario walkthroughs with reproduction steps
- Browser-specific testing instructions
- Support response templates
- Monitoring and telemetry recommendations

**Use Case**: When a user reports token loss, use this guide to quickly identify the specific cause through console logs and user actions.

### üî¨ [PAT_TOKEN_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md](./PAT_TOKEN_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md)
**Deep technical analysis of authentication code flows**

**Contents**:
- Complete authentication flow diagrams
- Browser fingerprint generation deep dive
- Component authentication patterns with code locations
- Critical code paths (success and failure scenarios)
- Race condition analysis
- Error propagation patterns

## Quick Reference

### Most Likely Causes (in order)

1. **Browser Fingerprint Changes** (HIGH)
   - Window resize
   - Browser zoom changes  
   - Moving between monitors
   - Display settings changes

2. **New Tab Behavior** (HIGH)
   - sessionStorage is not shared across tabs
   - Ctrl+Click or "Open in New Tab" creates new session

3. **Token Expiration** (MEDIUM)
   - 24-hour hard expiration
   - No refresh mechanism

4. **Browser-Specific Behavior** (MEDIUM)
   - Hard refresh behavior varies
   - Safari more aggressive than Chrome/Firefox

### How to Use These Documents

**For Issue Triage**:
1. Start with PAT_TOKEN_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md
2. Follow the quick debugging steps
3. Match console logs to scenarios
4. Apply appropriate support response template

**For Understanding the Problem**:
1. Read PAT_TOKEN_LOSS_INVESTIGATION.md executive summary
2. Review the prioritized scenario list
3. Check browser-specific behaviors

**For Implementation**:
1. Review PAT_TOKEN_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md code flows
2. Identify specific failure points
3. Refer to recommendations in main investigation report
4. Consider security vs. usability trade-offs

### Console Messages to Watch For

```
[SecureTokenStorage] Browser fingerprint mismatch - possible security issue
[SecureTokenStorage] Stored token has expired
[SecureTokenStorage] No secure token found in storage
[SecureTokenStorage] Decrypted token failed validation
```

### Key Code Locations

- **Token Storage**: `src/services/secureTokenStorage.js` (lines 128-189)
- **Token Retrieval**: `src/services/secureTokenStorage.js` (lines 195-251)
- **Fingerprint Generation**: `src/services/secureTokenStorage.js` (lines 25-50)
- **Token Clearing**: `src/services/githubService.js` (lines 76, 133, 2531)
- **Page Reloads**: 12 locations across components (see investigation report)

## Investigation Metadata

- **Issue**: PAT token disappears unexpectedly
- **Investigation Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Status**: Investigation Complete - Implementation NOT Required
- **Documents**: 3 comprehensive analysis documents
- **Total Analysis**: ~44,000 words across all documents
- **Code Locations Analyzed**: 15+ files, 30+ code sections
- **Scenarios Identified**: 7 primary scenarios with sub-scenarios
- **Testing Procedures**: 5 detailed test cases

## Next Steps (If Implementation is Approved)

1. **Immediate**: Add telemetry/logging to identify which scenarios occur most frequently in production
2. **Short-term**: Relax fingerprint validation to exclude volatile components (screen size, canvas)
3. **Medium-term**: Implement "Remember Me" option using localStorage with clear user consent
4. **Long-term**: Create React Authentication Context to prevent race conditions and provide consistent state

## Notes

- **Security Trade-offs**: Any changes must balance security (token protection) vs. usability (persistent login)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Solutions must work across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback when token expires or is invalidated is critical
- **GitHub PAT Security**: These are powerful credentials and must be handled carefully

**Investigation Complete** - Ready for review and decision on implementation approach.
