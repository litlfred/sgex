## Asset Lifecycle Management

### 1. Asset Creation Phase

#### Initial Asset Creation
The asset creation process varies by component type and follows established patterns:

**Standard Creation Workflow:**
1. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate asset template based on component type
2. **Metadata Definition**: Specify asset properties (name, description, purpose, etc.)
3. **Content Development**: Create core asset content using specialized editors
4. **Validation**: Perform initial quality checks and standards compliance validation
5. **Version Control**: Commit to GitHub repository with appropriate branching strategy

**Component-Specific Creation Processes:**

##### Business Process Assets (BPMN)
- Use integrated BPMN editor with graphical modeling interface
- Generate SVG visualizations automatically
- Validate against OMG BPMN 2.0 specification
- Link to related personas and user scenarios

##### Decision Logic Assets (DMN)
- Create decision tables using DMN editor interface
- Define input/output parameters and business rules
- Validate against OMG DMN 1.3 specification
- Generate executable FHIR PlanDefinition resources

##### Data Element Assets (OCL)
- Define concepts using Open Concept Lab integration
- Map to standard terminologies (SNOMED CT, ICD-11, etc.)
- Create value sets and code systems
- Generate FHIR CodeSystem and ValueSet resources

### 2. Asset Modification and Evolution

#### Change Management Process
All asset modifications follow a structured change management process:

1. **Change Request**: Document need for modification with rationale
2. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze effects on dependent assets and systems
3. **Approval Process**: Obtain necessary approvals based on change scope
4. **Implementation**: Make changes using appropriate editing tools
5. **Validation**: Ensure continued compliance and quality standards
6. **Documentation**: Update related documentation and metadata
7. **Publication**: Release updated assets through established channels

#### Version Control Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning**: Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version numbering
- **Branch Management**: Implement GitFlow or similar branching strategy
- **Tag Management**: Tag releases with appropriate version identifiers
- **Change Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive changelog documentation

#### Dependency Management
Assets may have complex interdependencies that must be managed:

- **Forward Dependencies**: Assets that depend on the current asset
- **Backward Dependencies**: Assets that the current asset depends on
- **Circular Dependencies**: Mutual dependencies requiring coordinated updates
- **External Dependencies**: Dependencies on external systems (IRIS, OCL, PCMT)

### 3. Asset Quality Assurance

#### Validation Framework
Each asset type has specific validation requirements:

**Business Logic Validation (L2 Layer):**
- **BPMN Validation**: Structural correctness and business rule compliance
- **DMN Validation**: Decision table completeness and logical consistency
- **Terminology Validation**: Concept definition accuracy and mapping correctness
- **Scenario Validation**: User story completeness and workflow coverage

**Technical Implementation Validation (L3 Layer):**
- **FHIR Validation**: Resource conformance and profile compliance
- **Schema Validation**: JSON/XML schema conformance checking
- **Terminology Binding**: Code system and value set validation
- **Implementation Guide**: Publication and conformance validation

#### Quality Metrics
Establish and monitor key quality indicators:

- **Completeness**: Percentage of required fields/sections completed
- **Accuracy**: Validation error rates and compliance scores
- **Consistency**: Cross-asset alignment and terminology consistency
- **Usability**: User feedback and accessibility measurements
- **Performance**: Load times, response rates, and system performance

### 4. Asset Publication and Distribution

#### Publication Workflow
Assets follow a structured publication process:

1. **Pre-Publication Review**: Final quality assurance and approval
2. **Build Process**: Generate implementation guides and derived assets
3. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment for final testing
4. **Production Release**: Publish to production environments
5. **Notification**: Inform stakeholders of new releases
6. **Documentation Update**: Update public documentation and release notes

#### Distribution Channels
Assets are distributed through multiple channels:

- **GitHub Repository**: Primary source code and version control
- **GitHub Pages**: Public implementation guide hosting
- **Package Registries**: FHIR package distribution (packages.fhir.org)
