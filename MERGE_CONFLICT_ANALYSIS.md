## Conflict Details

### What Changed in This PR Branch

Changed all badge icon paths from **absolute paths** to **relative paths** to fix 404 errors in feature branch deployments:

```javascript
// BEFORE (in this PR branch at commit 66f083c)
badge: 'cat-paw-info-icon.svg'        // Line 11
badge: 'cat-paw-workflow-icon.svg'    // Line 59
badge: 'cat-paw-lock-icon.svg'        // Line 93
badge: 'cat-paw-bug-icon.svg'         // Line ~150+
// ... and 13 more badge references
```

### What Changed in Main Branch

Main branch retained the **absolute paths** with `/sgex/` prefix:

```javascript
// CURRENT (in main branch at commit 09cfe1f)
badge: '/sgex/cat-paw-info-icon.svg'        // Line 11
badge: '/sgex/cat-paw-workflow-icon.svg'    // Line 59
badge: '/sgex/cat-paw-lock-icon.svg'        // Line 93
badge: '/sgex/cat-paw-bug-icon.svg'         // Line ~150+
// ... and 13 more badge references
```

### Why This Conflict Exists

Both branches modified the same badge path lines:
- **This PR branch:** Changed absolute paths (`/sgex/cat-paw-*.svg`) to relative paths (`cat-paw-*.svg`)
- **Main branch:** Added new badge references or modified help content while keeping absolute paths

Git cannot automatically merge because it doesn't know which version to keep.

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Accept This PR's Changes (Recommended) ‚úÖ

**What it does:** Keep all relative badge paths from this PR branch  
**Why recommended:** Fixes the 404 errors in feature branch deployments  

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Fixes 404 errors in all deployment scenarios (local, main, feature branches)
- ‚úÖ Simpler and more portable code
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded path prefixes
- ‚úÖ Browser resolves paths relative to current page URL
- ‚úÖ Already tested and working in this PR

**How to resolve:**
```bash
# Keep all changes from this PR branch
git checkout --ours src/services/helpContentService.js
git add src/services/helpContentService.js
```

**Then verify:** Check if any new badge references were added in main that need the relative path pattern applied.

---

### Option 2: Accept Main's Changes

**What it does:** Keep absolute badge paths from main branch  
**Why NOT recommended:** Will reintroduce 404 errors in feature branch deployments  

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå 404 errors will return in feature branch deployments
- ‚ùå Absolute paths don't work across different deployment contexts
- ‚ùå Undoes the fix this PR provides

**How to resolve:**
```bash
# Keep main branch version (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git checkout --theirs src/services/helpContentService.js
git add src/services/helpContentService.js
```

---

### Option 3: Manual Merge (Most Thorough) üîß

**What it does:** Carefully merge both changes, keeping relative paths while preserving any new content from main  

**When to use:** If main branch added new help topics or badge references  

**How to resolve:**
1. Open `src/services/helpContentService.js` in a text editor
2. Look for conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. For each badge path conflict:
   - Keep the **relative path** version (without `/sgex/` prefix)
   - Verify it matches pattern: `badge: 'cat-paw-*.svg'`
4. For any new content in main:
   - Keep the new content
   - But ensure any badge paths use relative format
5. Remove all conflict markers
6. Save the file
7. Test the changes
8. Stage the file: `git add src/services/helpContentService.js`

**Example resolution:**
```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD (this PR branch)
badge: 'cat-paw-icon.svg'
=======
badge: '/sgex/cat-paw-icon.svg'
>>>>>>> origin/main

// RESOLVED: Keep relative path from PR branch
badge: 'cat-paw-icon.svg'
```

## Recommended Resolution Steps

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Verify the conflict:**
```bash
git status
# Should show: "both modified: src/services/helpContentService.js"
```

2. **Review the conflict:**
```bash
git diff src/services/helpContentService.js
```

3. **Choose resolution strategy:**
   - **Quick fix:** Use Option 1 (accept PR changes) ‚úÖ
   - **Thorough fix:** Use Option 3 (manual merge) if main has new content

4. **For Option 1 (Recommended):**
```bash
# Accept this PR's changes
git checkout --ours src/services/helpContentService.js

# Check if main added any new badge references
git show origin/main:src/services/helpContentService.js | grep "badge:"

# If main has new badge references with absolute paths:
# Edit src/services/helpContentService.js manually to convert them to relative

# Stage the resolved file
git add src/services/helpContentService.js
```

5. **For Option 3 (Manual merge):**
```bash
# Open in your editor
code src/services/helpContentService.js

# Or use git mergetool
git mergetool src/services/helpContentService.js

# After resolving manually:
git add src/services/helpContentService.js
```

6. **Complete the merge:**
```bash
git commit -m "Merge main into copilot/fix-404-errors-for-assets

Resolved conflict in helpContentService.js by keeping relative badge paths
from this PR to ensure 404 fix works in all deployment scenarios."
```

7. **Verify the resolution:**
```bash
# Check the resolved file
git show HEAD:src/services/helpContentService.js | grep "badge:"

# Should show relative paths like:
# badge: 'cat-paw-icon.svg'
# badge: 'cat-paw-info-icon.svg'
# etc.
```

8. **Test the changes:**
```bash
npm run build
npm test
```
