Deployment trigger #3 - Fixed React Router basename for subdirectory deployment

This trigger is to test the fix for GitHub Pages deployment where the React Router 
basename is now dynamically set based on the PUBLIC_URL environment variable.

The issue was that React Router was hardcoded with basename="/sgex" but for 
subdirectory deployments like copilot-fix-418, it should use basename="/copilot-fix-418/"

Fixed in App.js:
- Changed from hardcoded `basename="/sgex"`
- To dynamic `basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL || '/sgex'}`

This should resolve the issue where the deployed application wasn't loading 
properly at https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/copilot-fix-418/
