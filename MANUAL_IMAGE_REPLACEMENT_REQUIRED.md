   - âœ… Theme switching verified (images change correctly)
   - âœ… Text visibility verified (contrast improvement confirmed)
   - âœ… Responsive design verified

3. **Documentation** - Complete
   - âœ… Implementation summary created
   - âœ… Image replacement instructions provided
   - âœ… README for manual image download created

## Required Manual Step ðŸ”§

**Replace the placeholder images with actual images from the GitHub issue:**

### Step 1: Download Images
Download these two images manually from the GitHub issue:

1. **Light Mode Image**
   - URL: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eee86aa1-1a53-45cd-98e7-8c8f2a41023d
   - Save as: `public/pat-login.png`

2. **Dark Mode Image**
   - URL: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2e3cb10-c991-4bae-aaa1-70f2492cb7cf
   - Save as: `public/pat-login_grey_tabby.png`

### Step 2: Verify Images
After replacing the images:
```bash
cd /path/to/sgex
npm start
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/sgex
# Toggle between light and dark modes to verify both images appear correctly
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push
```bash
git add public/pat-login.png public/pat-login_grey_tabby.png
git commit -m "Replace placeholder PAT login images with actual images from issue"
git push
```

## Why This Step Is Manual

The GitHub user-attachments domain is blocked in the sandboxed CI/CD environment for security reasons. The images must be downloaded manually by a user with browser access to GitHub.

## Verification Checklist

After replacing the images, verify:
- [ ] Light mode shows the cat with PAT sign on beige/light background
- [ ] Dark mode shows the orange/ginger cat with PAT sign
- [ ] Image sizes are appropriate (similar to other card images ~2-4MB)
- [ ] Images load quickly and don't cause layout shifts
- [ ] Mobile responsive design still works correctly
- [ ] Theme toggle switches between the two images smoothly

## Current Placeholder Behavior

The current placeholder images (copied from `sgex-mascot.png`) demonstrate that:
- âœ… The theme switching mechanism works correctly
- âœ… The image positioning and sizing is correct
- âœ… The responsive design scales properly
- âœ… The alt text integration is working

The only difference is the image content itself, which will be corrected when the actual images are downloaded and replaced.
