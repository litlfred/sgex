# Session Watch Feedback Improvements Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Visual Feedback During Refresh
- Added `isRefreshingSession` state to track when a session refresh is in progress
- Added `lastSessionCheck` timestamp to show when the last check occurred
- Added `sessionRefreshCount` counter to show how many refreshes have been performed

### 2. Enhanced Watch Session Display
When watching for session updates, users now see:
- **During refresh**: "ðŸ”„ Refreshing session... (#1)" with refresh count
- **Between refreshes**: "ðŸ”„ Watching for updates (every 10s)"
- **Last checked timestamp**: "Last checked: Dec 20, 2:35 PM"
- **Refresh counter**: "Refreshes: 5"

### 3. Inactive Session Feedback
Even when no active copilot session is detected, users see:
- **During check**: "ðŸ”„ Checking for active Copilot session..."
- **When idle**: "âšª No active Copilot session detected"
- **Last checked timestamp**: Shows when the last check was performed

### 4. Improved UX Flow
1. **Start watching**: Immediately performs initial refresh with visual feedback
2. **Auto-refresh**: Every 10 seconds, shows "Refreshing..." for 1 second
3. **Activity feedback**: Counter increments, timestamps update
4. **Clear indicators**: User always knows when system is active vs idle

## Key Benefits
- **Transparency**: Users can see when the system is actively checking
- **Progress tracking**: Refresh counter and timestamps provide activity proof
- **Immediate feedback**: Visual state changes happen instantly when actions occur
- **Clear status**: Distinction between "watching", "refreshing", and "idle" states

## Testing
The enhanced feedback ensures users can:
1. See when a session refresh is actually happening (not just that watching is enabled)
2. Know when the last check occurred via timestamp
3. Track how many refreshes have been performed
4. Understand the difference between active checking and passive waiting

This addresses the user's request for "indication when a session refresh is made or a check to see if there is an open session so the user knows something is happening."
