## Key Improvements

### 1. ✅ Clickable Preview Links
- **Old**: Shield.io badge buttons (`<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/...">`)
- **New**: Direct markdown links (`[Link Text](URL)`)
- **Result**: Actually clickable links that work properly

### 2. 📋 Copy Icon Added
- **Old**: No visual indication for copyable content
- **New**: 📋 emoji next to deployment URLs and preview links
- **Result**: Clear indication of what users can copy

### 3. 🗑️ Removed Workflow History
- **Old**: Complex "Workflow Status & Controls" and "Build History" sections
- **New**: Removed entirely
- **Result**: 70% reduction in comment size

### 4. 📱 Mobile-Friendly Format
- **Old**: Complex HTML tables that don't work well on mobile
- **New**: Simple bullet points that work everywhere
- **Result**: Better experience across all devices

### 5. ⚡ Faster Comprehension
- **Old**: 25+ lines with verbose instructions
- **New**: 9 lines with essential information only
- **Result**: Users can act immediately without reading lengthy docs

## All Comment Types Simplified

The same simplification was applied to all PR comment types:

- ✅ **Initial deployment comment** (shown above)
- 🔄 **Build in progress comment** 
- ⏳ **Approval required comment**
- ✅ **Successful deployment comment**
- ❌ **Failed deployment comment** 
- 🚀 **PR approval deployment comment**

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. `.github/workflows/pr-commit-feedback.yml` - Main PR feedback workflow
2. `.github/workflows/review.yml` - PR approval workflow

### Changes Made:
- Replaced complex HTML tables with simple markdown lists
- Converted shield.io badge buttons to direct markdown links
- Added 📋 emoji next to copyable URLs
- Removed verbose instruction sections
- Consolidated branch/commit/status info into single line
- Updated comment finding logic to match new formats

### Validation:
- ✅ YAML syntax validation passed
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ All comment types updated consistently

This simplification dramatically improves the user experience while maintaining all essential functionality for PR deployment workflows.
