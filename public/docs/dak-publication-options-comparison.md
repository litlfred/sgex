# DAK Publication Implementation - Client-Side Approach Comparison

## Overview

This document compares client-side implementation approaches for creating DAK publication views, focusing on browser-based HTML rendering optimized for print-to-PDF functionality. All options maintain the constraint of no server-side processing while leveraging existing React components and providing individual publication views for each DAK component.

## Implementation Options Comparison

**Architecture:**
- Extend existing React components (BPMNViewer, etc.) with print modes
- CSS print media queries for optimal browser print-to-PDF output
- Component-specific publication views accessible from DAK dashboard
- DAK PDF styling extraction for visual consistency

| Aspect | Rating | Details |

## Recommendation Summary

### Primary Recommendation: Option 1 - Enhanced React Components with Print CSS

Based on the specific requirements articulated in the comment, **Option 1** is the clear choice because it:

✅ **Meets Client-Side Requirement:** No server-side processing - purely browser-based  
✅ **Leverages Existing Components:** Reuses BPMNViewer and other established React components  
✅ **Individual Component Publications:** Provides separate publication views for each DAK component  
✅ **Print-to-PDF Focus:** Optimized for browser print functionality rather than direct PDF generation  
✅ **DAK Styling Integration:** Supports extraction of graphics and styling from uploaded DAK PDFs  
✅ **Fast Implementation:** Builds on existing architecture with minimal disruption  

### Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1:** Extend existing components with print modes and basic CSS print optimization
2. **Phase 2:** Implement BPMN page break handling using viewport segmentation
3. **Phase 3:** Add DAK PDF styling extraction for visual consistency
4. **Phase 4:** Optimize print quality and cross-browser compatibility

### Technical Approach

```jsx
// Example implementation extending existing BPMNViewer
const BPMNPublicationView = ({ user, repo, branch, bpmnPath }) => {
  return (
    <div className="publication-view bpmn-publication">
      <PublicationHeader dakInfo={{ user, repo, branch }} />
      <BPMNViewer
        user={user}
        repo={repo}
        branch={branch}
        assetPath={bpmnPath}
        printMode={true}
        enablePageBreaks={true}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

This approach directly addresses the comment requirements while providing a practical path forward that maximizes existing component investments and maintains the client-side architecture constraint.

## DAK Dashboard Integration Plan

### Publications Tab Enhancement

The DAK dashboard will be enhanced with individual publication links for each component:

```
DAK Dashboard > Publications Tab:
├── Business Processes → /publications/business-processes/{user}/{repo}/{branch}
├── Decision Logic → /publications/decision-logic/{user}/{repo}/{branch}
├── Data Forms → /publications/data-forms/{user}/{repo}/{branch}
├── Terminology → /publications/terminology/{user}/{repo}/{branch}
├── FHIR Profiles → /publications/fhir-profiles/{user}/{repo}/{branch}
└── Test Data → /publications/test-data/{user}/{repo}/{branch}
```

Each publication view will:
- Use existing component viewers in print-optimized mode
- Extract styling from uploaded DAK PDFs for consistency
- Handle BPMN diagram page breaks intelligently
- Provide browser print-to-PDF functionality
- Maintain professional appearance without direct WHO branding

This implementation strategy delivers exactly what was requested: client-side publication views for individual DAK components that leverage existing React components and produce high-quality print output through browser print-to-PDF functionality.
