# SGEX Workbench Project Plan

## Project Overview

The SMART Guidelines Exchange (SGEX) Workbench is a browser-based, standards-compliant collaborative editor for WHO SMART Guidelines Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs). This document outlines the project plan for developing comprehensive documentation and establishing the foundation for the SGEX Workbench.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Requirements documentation and analysis
- Solution architecture design
- Technical documentation structure
- Integration specifications with GitHub services
- UI/UX design guidelines following WHO SMART Guidelines branding
- Security and privacy considerations
- Deployment strategy documentation

### Out of Scope (for this phase)
- Application code implementation
- Detailed L2/L3 artifact schemas
- Detailed workflow specifications (only examples provided)
- Testing frameworks setup
- CI/CD pipeline implementation

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation Foundation (Current)
**Status**: In Progress

**Objectives**:
- Establish comprehensive project documentation
- Define requirements and solution architecture
- Create structured documentation for future development

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Project plan documentation
- [ ] Requirements specification
- [ ] Solution architecture documentation
- [ ] README and project structure

**Timeline**: Initial documentation phase

### Phase 2: Architecture Refinement (Future)
**Objectives**:
- Refine technical architecture based on stakeholder feedback
- Detailed component specifications
- Integration pattern documentation

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (Future)
**Objectives**:
- Development roadmap creation
- Technical specifications for implementation
- Testing strategy documentation

## Key Stakeholders

- **WHO SMART Guidelines Team**: Requirements and branding guidance
- **Development Team**: Technical implementation
- **End Users**: DAK authors and collaborators using GitHub

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Documentation**: All required documentation artifacts are created and organized
2. **Clear Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements are clearly defined
3. **Solid Architecture**: Technical architecture supports all identified use cases
4. **WHO Compliance**: All documentation follows WHO SMART Guidelines branding and terminology
5. **GitHub Integration**: Clear integration strategy with GitHub services is documented

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **GitHub API Limitations**: Mitigation through proper API usage patterns and error handling
- **Browser Compatibility**: Mitigation through modern browser standards and progressive enhancement
- **Security Concerns**: Mitigation through Personal Access Token-based authentication and client-side only architecture

### Project Risks
- **Requirement Changes**: Mitigation through iterative documentation updates
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Mitigation through regular review cycles

## Documentation Structure

```

├── project-plan.md          # This document
├── requirements.md          # Functional and non-functional requirements
├── solution-architecture.md # Technical architecture and design
└── [future additions]       # Additional documentation as project evolves
```

## Communication Plan

- Documentation updates will be tracked through Git commits
- Major changes will be documented in commit messages
- Review cycles will be conducted as needed based on stakeholder feedback

## Quality Assurance

- All documentation follows consistent formatting and structure
- Technical accuracy validated through architectural review
- WHO SMART Guidelines compliance verified
- Accessibility considerations documented throughout

## Next Steps

1. Complete current phase documentation deliverables
2. Stakeholder review of initial documentation
3. Incorporate feedback and iterate on documentation
4. Plan transition to subsequent project phases
