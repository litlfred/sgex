## 🔧 Technical Details

### Root Cause
The 404.html routing logic was treating `index.html` as a component name when parsing URLs like `/sgex/branch/index.html`, which created invalid redirect URLs (`/sgex/branch/?/index.html`) that triggered the redirect loop detection mechanism.

### Solution Implemented
Added a special case handler in 404.html (lines 119-126) to detect when the last path segment is `index.html` and redirect to the branch root instead:

```javascript
// Special handling for index.html - redirect to branch root
if (pathSegments.length === 3 && pathSegments[2] === 'index.html') {
  // /sgex/{branch}/index.html -> /sgex/{branch}/
  var branchRootUrl = '/sgex/' + branch + '/';
  console.log('SGEX 404.html: index.html detected, redirecting to branch root:', branchRootUrl);
  redirectToSPA(branchRootUrl, '');
  return;
}
```

## ✅ Testing & Validation

### Automated Tests
```
PASS src/tests/404-local-branch-fallback.test.js (15 tests)
  ✓ should implement branch-first fallback correctly
  ✓ should fall back to main after branch root fails
  ✓ should handle main branch correctly
  ✓ should reduce redirect threshold from 3 to 2
  ✓ should try local branch first before falling back to main
  ✓ should fall back to main only after branch fallback fails
  ✓ should handle direct branch root access that fails
  ✓ should preserve user/repo context during fallback
  ✓ should handle all branches optimistically
  ✓ should track redirect attempts with timestamps
  ✓ should clear old redirect attempts
  ✓ should recognize branch deployment patterns
  ✓ should distinguish between component-first and branch-first patterns
  ✓ should handle index.html in branch deployment URLs ← NEW
  ✓ should not create ?/index.html redirect URLs ← NEW

PASS src/tests/404-routing.test.js (6 tests)
  ✓ should be present in build output
  ✓ should contain required SPA routing script
  ✓ should handle GitHub Pages SGEX deployment URLs
  ✓ should handle branch deployment URLs optimistically
  ✓ should handle standalone deployment
  ✓ should preserve query parameters and hash in redirection

### Manual Verification
✅ Verified with custom verification script testing:
- `/sgex/copilot-add-dak-component-indicators/index.html` → `/sgex/copilot-add-dak-component-indicators/`
- `/sgex/feature-branch/index.html` → `/sgex/feature-branch/`
- `/sgex/main/index.html` → `/sgex/main/`
- Normal component routes remain unaffected

### Lint Checks
✅ No lint errors introduced
✅ No eslint warnings for modified files
✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions
