# üéâ Multi-Branch GitHub Pages Deployment - READY!

## What Happens Next

When this PR is merged or pushed, the new deployment system will automatically activate:

### 1. **Immediate Deployment**
- This branch (`copilot/fix-243` ‚Üí `copilot-fix-243`) will be deployed to: 
  - **Branch Preview**: https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/sgex/copilot-fix-243/
  - **Landing Page**: https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/

### 2. **Future Branch Pushes**
Every time code is pushed to any branch (except `gh-pages`):
- Branch gets its own preview at `/sgex/branch-name/`
- Landing page automatically updates with new branch card
- Safe cleanup removes old deployments

### 3. **What You'll See**

#### Landing Page (Root)
```
https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/
```  
- üê± Cat-themed header: "SGEX Branch Previews"
- Interactive cards for each branch with:
  - Branch name (original, e.g., "feature/awesome")
  - Commit hash (short)
  - Last updated date
  - "üöÄ View Preview" button
- Links to individual branch previews
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

#### Branch Previews
```
https://litlfred.github.io/sgex/sgex/BRANCH-NAME/
```
- Full React application for each branch
- Same UI/UX as main application
- Independent deployment per branch
- Clean URLs with safe branch names

### 4. **Safety Features Active**
- ‚úÖ All directory operations validated with `readlink -f`
- ‚úÖ Branch names sanitized (slashes become dashes)
- ‚úÖ Git-managed cleanup (no dangerous `rm -rf`)
- ‚úÖ Never runs on `gh-pages` branch
- ‚úÖ Multiple validation checkpoints

### 5. **Example Branch Mappings**
| Original Branch | Safe Directory | Preview URL |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | `main` | `/sgex/main/` |
| `feature/auth` | `feature-auth` | `/sgex/feature-auth/` |
| `bugfix/login-fix` | `bugfix-login-fix` | `/sgex/bugfix-login-fix/` |
| `copilot/fix-243` | `copilot-fix-243` | `/sgex/copilot-fix-243/` |

### 6. **Monitoring**
Check deployment status:
- GitHub Actions tab for workflow logs
- Look for "Safe Multi-Branch GitHub Pages Deployment"
- Detailed logging shows all safety validations

### 7. **Testing Commands**
You can test locally:
```bash
# Test branch-specific build
npm run build:multi-branch branch

# Test root landing page build  
npm run build:multi-branch root

# Run comprehensive test suite
./scripts/test-deployment.sh
```
