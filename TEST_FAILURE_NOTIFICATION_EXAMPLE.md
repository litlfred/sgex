## Benefits

This notification provides:

1. **Immediate Awareness**: Contributors know instantly when their changes break the build
2. **Comprehensive Context**: All relevant links and information in one place
3. **Actionable Guidance**: Clear next steps to resolve the issue
4. **Workflow Transparency**: Understanding of what failed and why
5. **Quick Resolution**: Direct links to logs and retry mechanisms

## Testing

To test this system:

1. Create a PR with intentionally failing code (e.g., syntax error)
2. Push the changes to trigger a workflow
3. Wait for the workflow to fail
4. Check that the failure notification appears on the PR
5. Verify all links work correctly
6. Fix the issue and confirm the workflow succeeds on retry

The system will automatically detect the failure and post this type of rich, informative comment.
