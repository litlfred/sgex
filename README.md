# SGEX Workbench

**A collaborative workbench for WHO SMART Guidelines**

SGEX (SMART Guidelines Exchange) is an experimental collaborative project in the development of a workbench of tools for creating high fidelity WHO SMART Guidelines Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs).

## Mission Statement

SGEX is designed to make it easier and faster to develop high fidelity SMART Guidelines Digital Adaptation Kits through collaborative community-driven development. Our mission is to:

- **Enable Community Collaboration**: Provide a platform where healthcare professionals, developers, and WHO contributors can work together in real-time
- **Streamline DAK Development**: Offer comprehensive authoring tools that simplify the creation and editing of digital health guidelines
- **Foster Innovation Through Experimentation**: Create a safe space for testing new features and approaches through branch-based development
- **Support Rapid Evolution**: Enable the workbench to evolve continuously based on community feedback and real-world usage

## How to Contribute

SGEX thrives on community contributions. Here's how you can be part of this collaborative effort:

### 1. üêõ Report a Bug
Found an issue? Use our bug reporting system to let us know what's wrong. Every bug report helps improve the workbench and makes it more reliable for everyone.

### 2. üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Make a Feature Request  
Have an idea for improvement? Request new features through our issue system. Your wishes and suggestions help shape the future direction of SGEX.

### 3. ü§ñ Collaborative Development
Once triaged, features are assigned to coding agents who implement solutions collaboratively with the community. This ensures that development aligns with real user needs.

### 4. üåü Community Evolution
Through collaborative discussion and feedback, the community evolves the workbench in real time, making it continuously better at serving the needs of SMART Guidelines development.
