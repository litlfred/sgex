# SGEX Workbench (WHO SMART Guidelines Exchange)

This repository contains the source code, schemas, and documentation for the SGEX Workbenchâ€”a browser-based, standards-compliant collaborative editor for WHO SMART Guidelines Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs).

## About

The SGEX Workbench is a browser-based, static web application for collaborative editing of WHO SMART Guidelines Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs) content stored in GitHub repositories.

- All UI schemas are rendered using [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/) for standards compliance and accessibility.
- All schemas and documentation follow the terminology and branding of [WHO SMART Guidelines](https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines).

## WHO SMART Guidelines DAK Components

The SGEX Workbench supports editing of the **8 core Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) components** as defined by the WHO SMART Guidelines framework. These components are organized into two levels:

### Level 2: Business Logic & Processes
1. **Business Processes** - BPMN workflows and business process definitions
2. **Decision Support Logic** - DMN decision tables and clinical decision support 
3. **Indicators & Measures** - Performance indicators and measurement definitions
4. **Data Entry Forms** - Structured data collection forms and questionnaires

### Level 3: Technical Implementation  
5. **Terminology** - Code systems, value sets, and concept maps
6. **FHIR Profiles** - FHIR resource profiles and structure definitions
7. **FHIR Extensions** - Custom FHIR extensions and data elements
8. **Test Data & Examples** - Sample data and test cases for validation

*Note: Scheduling tables are considered a special case of decision tables and are included within the Decision Support Logic component.*
