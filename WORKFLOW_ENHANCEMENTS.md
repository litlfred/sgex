# GitHub API Workflow Dashboard Enhancements

## Overview

This implementation enhances the PR badge workflow dashboard to provide full GitHub API integration for workflow dispatch and status interactions as requested in issue #961.

## New Features Added

### 1. Job Details Fetching (`getWorkflowRunJobs()`)

The `githubActionsService.js` now includes functionality to retrieve detailed job information for workflow runs:

```javascript
// Fetch jobs for a specific workflow run
const jobs = await githubActionsService.getWorkflowRunJobs(runId);
```

**API Endpoint Used:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/jobs`

**Response includes:**
- Job name, status, and conclusion
- Job start/completion times and duration
- Runner information
- Individual job steps with detailed status
- Direct links to job logs

### 2. Enhanced Status Parsing

Added comprehensive status parsing for jobs and steps:

- **`parseJobStatus()`**: Converts raw GitHub API job data into normalized status objects
- **`parseStepStatus()`**: Processes individual job steps with proper status indicators
- **Duration calculation**: Automatic computation of job and step execution times

### 3. Expandable Workflow Display

The `WorkflowDashboard.js` component now supports:

- **Toggle Expansion**: "Show jobs" / "Hide jobs" buttons for each workflow
- **Job Cards**: Individual job display with status badges and timing information
- **Step Details**: Collapsible step-by-step execution breakdown
- **Progressive Loading**: Jobs are fetched on-demand when expanded

### 4. Visual Enhancements

#### Status Indicators
- ðŸŸ¢ **Succeeded**: Completed successfully
- ðŸ”´ **Failed**: Execution failed
- ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress**: Currently running
- ðŸŸ  **Waiting**: Awaiting approval
- âšª **Skipped**: Step was skipped
- ðŸŸ¡ **Cancelled**: Execution was cancelled

#### Interactive Elements
- Expandable job sections with smooth animations
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Real-time status updates with auto-refresh
- Direct links to GitHub workflow runs and logs

## Implementation Details

### GitHub API Integration

The enhancement uses the following GitHub API endpoints as requested:

1. **Workflow Dispatch** (already implemented):
   ```
   POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow_id}/dispatches
   ```

2. **Workflow Runs** (already implemented):
   ```
   GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs
   GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}
   ```

3. **Job Details** (newly added):
   ```
   GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/jobs
   ```

### Code Structure

#### Service Layer (`githubActionsService.js`)
- `getWorkflowRunJobs(runId)`: Fetches job details for a workflow run
- `parseJobStatus(job)`: Normalizes job status data
- `parseStepStatus(step)`: Normalizes step status data

#### UI Component (`WorkflowDashboard.js`)
- `toggleWorkflowExpansion()`: Handles job detail expansion/collapse
- Job loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive job display

#### Styling (`WorkflowDashboard.css`)
- Expandable job sections with animations
- Status badge styling for jobs and steps
- Mobile-responsive layout adjustments

## Usage Example

```javascript
// In a React component
<WorkflowDashboard
  branchName="feature-branch"
  githubActionsService={githubActionsService}
  isAuthenticated={true}
  onWorkflowAction={(action) => console.log('Workflow action:', action)}
/>
```

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests added to verify:
- Job fetching functionality
- Status parsing accuracy
- Error handling scenarios
- Duration calculations
- API integration

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling for:
- Network failures during job fetching
- Missing or malformed API responses
- Authentication/permission issues
- Rate limiting scenarios

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Jobs are only fetched when expanded
- **Caching**: Job data is cached per run ID
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal re-renders during status updates
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable refresh intervals for status monitoring

## Mobile Responsiveness

The enhanced dashboard is fully responsive with:
- Collapsible job sections on small screens
- Touch-friendly expansion controls
- Optimized layout for mobile viewing
- Proper text sizing and spacing

## Future Enhancements

The foundation is now in place for additional features:
- Log streaming integration
- Workflow dependency visualization
- Job artifact download links
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

## Conclusion

This implementation fully addresses the requirements in issue #961 by providing complete GitHub API integration for workflow dispatch and status interactions, with an enhanced expandable job details display in the workflow dashboard.
