# Framework Compliance Check Improvements

## Summary

This document describes the improvements made to address issues in the Framework Compliance Report. The compliance checker had overly aggressive LOW PRIORITY check heuristics that resulted in many false positives.

## Changes Made

### Refined Detection Heuristics for LOW PRIORITY Checks

1. **Issue Tracking Service Integration (Check 13)**
   - Changed from broad pattern matching to specific function detection
   - Now only flags components with actual issue tracking functions like `createIssue`, `trackIssue`
   - Fixed false positive: DAKSelection no longer flagged

2. **Bookmark Service Integration (Check 14)**
   - Changed from matching any navigation component to only main content pages
   - Excludes simple utilities, redirects, and error pages
   - Only flags Editors, Viewers, Dashboards, and Managers where bookmarking makes sense

3. **Help Content Registration (Check 15)**
   - Raised character threshold from 800 to 3000+ for editors
   - Now requires editors to have save functionality
   - Only flags truly complex editing interfaces, not selection pages

4. **Tutorial Integration (Check 16)**
   - Changed from matching any Editor/Manager/Configuration/Selection to requiring actual editing capability
   - Now requires editors to have save functionality
   - Configuration pages must have forms with submit capability

## Results

### Before
- **0 fully compliant pages (0%)**
- 23 pages with partial compliance
- Many false positive warnings

### After
- **6 fully compliant pages (27%)**
- 16 pages with partial compliance
- Significantly reduced false positives

### Newly Compliant Pages
1. PersonaViewer (16/16 - 100%)
2. SelectProfilePage (16/16 - 100%)
3. OrganizationSelection (16/16 - 100%)
4. DAKConfiguration (16/16 - 100%)
5. DashboardRedirect (16/16 - 100%)
6. NotFound (16/16 - 100%)

### Improved Scores
- Many pages improved from 56-75% to 81-94%
- Overall compliance increased from 0% to 27%
- Exit code remains 0 (no non-compliant pages)

## Remaining Issues

The remaining issues are now more legitimate and actionable:

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- 4 pages with nested layout components

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- 10 pages missing userAccessService integration
- 5 pages should use dataAccessLayer
- 4 landing pages missing WHO blue gradient background

**LOW PRIORITY:**
- 6 pages could add bookmarkService
- 2 asset editors could add stagingGroundService
- 4 complex pages could add help content
- 4 editors could add tutorials

## Testing

All compliance checker output formats confirmed working:
- ✅ Standard format (`npm run check-framework-compliance`)
- ✅ Condensed format (`--condensed`)
- ✅ JSON format (`--json`)
- ✅ PR comment format (`--format pr-comment`)
- ✅ Help text (`--help`)

## Impact

1. **Better Signal-to-Noise**: Developers can now focus on legitimate issues
2. **Maintained Strictness**: HIGH/MEDIUM priority checks unchanged
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Exit code behavior preserved
4. **Improved Accuracy**: False positives significantly reduced
