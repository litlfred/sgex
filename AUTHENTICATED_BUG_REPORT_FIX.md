# Authenticated Bug Report UI Fix

## Issue
Authenticated users were not seeing the fancy bug report UI when clicking on the bug report button. Instead, they were being redirected to the GitHub issue page, just like unauthenticated users.

## Root Cause
The code was incorrectly checking the authentication state by directly accessing the `githubService.isAuthenticated` property instead of calling the `githubService.isAuth()` method.

### Why this matters:
- `isAuthenticated` is a **property** that can be directly set to `true` or `false`
- `isAuth()` is a **method** that checks both:
  1. The `isAuthenticated` property is `true`, AND
  2. The `octokit` instance exists and is not `null`

This dual check ensures that the authentication state is valid and the GitHub API client is properly initialized.

## Changes Made

### 1. HelpModal.js (Line 77)
**Before:**
```javascript
const isAuthenticated = githubService.isAuthenticated;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isAuthenticated = githubService.isAuth();
```

### 2. BugReportForm.js (5 instances)

**Line 163 - API submission check:**
```javascript
// Before:
if (githubService.isAuthenticated) {

// After:
if (githubService.isAuth()) {
```

**Line 628 - Context display:**
```javascript
// Before:
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> {githubService.isAuthenticated ? 'Authenticated' : 'Demo Mode'}</li>

// After:
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> {githubService.isAuth() ? 'Authenticated' : 'Demo Mode'}</li>
```

**Line 684 - Button text:**
```javascript
// Before:
{submitting ? 'Opening...' : 
 githubService.isAuthenticated ? 'Submit Issue' : 'Open in GitHub'}

// After:
{submitting ? 'Opening...' : 
 githubService.isAuth() ? 'Submit Issue' : 'Open in GitHub'}
```

**Line 709 - Authentication status display:**
```javascript
// Before:
{githubService.isAuthenticated ? (

// After:
{githubService.isAuth() ? (
```

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite was added in `src/tests/AuthenticatedBugReportUI.test.js` that validates:
1. HelpModal shows bug report form when authenticated
2. HelpModal redirects to GitHub when not authenticated
3. BugReportForm uses `isAuth()` for authentication checks
4. BugReportForm shows correct UI for authenticated users
5. BugReportForm shows correct UI for unauthenticated users
6. The `isAuth()` method is preferred over the `isAuthenticated` property

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Authenticated Users:
1. Click on "Report an issue" in the help menu
2. The fancy bug report form appears in a modal overlay
3. User can fill out the form and submit directly to GitHub via API
4. Success message shows "Issue #123 has been created successfully!"

### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. Click on "Report an issue" in the help menu
2. User is redirected to GitHub's issue creation page
3. User must manually fill out the form on GitHub

## Impact
- **Minimal changes**: Only 6 lines of code changed
- **No breaking changes**: The fix maintains backward compatibility
- **Improved UX**: Authenticated users now get the intended fancy UI experience
- **Consistent pattern**: Aligns with other parts of the codebase that properly use `isAuth()`
