# PR Commit Feedback Testing

This file is used to test the PR commit feedback workflow improvements.

## Test Cases

1. **Approval Required**: When a commit is pushed and deployment workflow needs approval
2. **Deployment Success**: When deployment completes successfully 
3. **Deployment Failure**: When deployment fails
4. **Comment Updates**: Ensuring comments are updated rather than duplicated

## Expected Behavior

- PR comments should appear automatically when commits trigger workflows that need approval
- Comments should include direct approval links and rerun buttons
- Comments should be updated in-place rather than creating multiple comments
- Integration between pr-commit-feedback.yml and branch-deployment.yml should be seamless
