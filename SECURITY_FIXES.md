# Security Vulnerability Fixes

This document describes the security fixes applied to address npm audit vulnerabilities and implement comprehensive security improvements.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities have been resolved using npm overrides in package.json:

### 1. nth-check (High Severity) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
- **CVE**: GHSA-rp65-9cf3-cjxr
- **Fix**: Upgraded to nth-check@2.1.1 via package.json overrides

### 2. postcss (Moderate Severity) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: PostCSS line return parsing error
- **CVE**: GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j
- **Fix**: Upgraded to postcss@8.5.6 via package.json overrides

### 3. webpack-dev-server (Moderate Severity) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Source code theft vulnerability
- **CVE**: GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h, GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v
- **Fix**: Upgraded to webpack-dev-server@5.2.1 via package.json overrides

### 4. PrismJS DOM Clobbering (Moderate Severity) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: PrismJS DOM Clobbering vulnerability
- **CVE**: GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg
- **Fix**: Upgraded to prismjs@1.30.0+ via package.json overrides

## New Security Enhancements

### 1. Secure Token Storage System
- **Problem**: GitHub PATs were stored in plain text in sessionStorage
- **Solution**: Implemented `SecureTokenStorage` service with:
  - XOR encryption with browser fingerprint-based key
  - Token format validation
  - Automatic expiration (24 hours)
  - Secure token masking for logs

### 2. Input Sanitization and Validation
- **Problem**: Potential XSS vulnerabilities from unsanitized user input
- **Solution**: Created `securityUtils.js` with comprehensive sanitization:
  - HTML entity escaping
  - URL scheme validation
  - Repository/username/branch name validation
  - Path traversal prevention
  - File path validation

### 3. Enhanced Logging Security
- **Problem**: Sensitive data could be exposed in logs
- **Solution**: Automatic log data sanitization to mask/remove sensitive fields

### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Problem**: Missing security headers for XSS protection
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive CSP headers:
  - Prevents code injection attacks
  - Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
  - Configures frame protection
  - Implements HTTPS enforcement

### 5. Security Headers Configuration
- **Files**: `public/_headers` (Netlify), security config in `src/config/securityConfig.js`
- **Headers**: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS, etc.

## Testing

### Security Test Suite
- **File**: `src/tests/security.test.js`
- **Coverage**: Input sanitization, token validation, XSS protection, path traversal prevention

### Run Security Tests
```bash
npm test -- src/tests/security.test.js
```

## Development Notes

### Alternative Development Options

Due to API changes between webpack-dev-server 4.x and 5.x, the `npm start` command may not work properly in some environments. This is because react-scripts@5.0.1 was built for webpack-dev-server 4.x.

**Alternative Development Options:**

1. **Use the build and serve script**:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
   This builds the project and serves it via Python's built-in HTTP server.

2. **Use the build folder manually**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   cd build
   python3 -m http.server 3000
   ```

### Production Impact

- **No impact on production builds**: `npm run build` works perfectly
- **No impact on tests**: `npm test` works perfectly  
- **All security vulnerabilities resolved**: `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities
- **Enhanced security**: New security measures protect against XSS, token theft, and other attacks

## Security Compliance

The application now complies with:
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- ✅ GitHub security best practices
- ✅ Modern web application security standards
- ✅ Content Security Policy requirements
- ✅ Secure token handling practices

## Documentation

- **Comprehensive Security Guide**: `SECURITY.md`
- **Security Configuration**: `src/config/securityConfig.js`
- **Security Utilities**: `src/utils/securityUtils.js`
- **Secure Token Storage**: `src/services/secureTokenStorage.js`

## Audit Status

Current status: **0 vulnerabilities** found in npm audit

All moderate and high severity vulnerabilities have been resolved through dependency overrides and security enhancements.
