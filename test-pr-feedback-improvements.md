## Button Types and Colors

- **Green (4CAF50)**: Success actions (approve, deploy, open preview)

- **Orange (FF9800)**: Retry/redeploy actions
- **Red (DC3545)**: Error investigation actions

## URL Parameters

All workflow dispatch URLs now include pre-filled parameters:
```

```

This eliminates the need for users to manually enter branch names.
