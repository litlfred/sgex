Thank you for your interest in contributing to the WHO SMART Guidelines Exchange (SGEX) Workbench!

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment** - Follow the [Development Setup](README.md#development-setup) instructions in the README
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a feature branch from `main`
4. Make your changes

6. Submit a pull request

## Guidelines

- Follow WHO SMART Guidelines branding and terminology
- Ensure all changes maintain accessibility standards
- Keep documentation up to date
- Write clear commit messages

### TypeScript-First Development

**SGEX Workbench uses TypeScript as the default for all code:**
- ‚úÖ **New code must be TypeScript**: Use `.ts` for modules, `.tsx` for React components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **JavaScript requires approval**: Any new JavaScript files (`.js`, `.jsx`) require explicit written approval from a code maintainer (@litlfred)
- üìù **Document exceptions**: If JavaScript is necessary (rare), document the technical reason
- üîÑ **Migration in progress**: Existing JavaScript files are being migrated to TypeScript
- üìä **JSON Schema required**: All TypeScript types must be exported and have corresponding JSON Schema validation
- üìã **OpenAPI documentation**: All API endpoints and services must be documented with OpenAPI specifications

**Before adding JavaScript code:**
1. Consider if TypeScript can be used instead
2. Document why JavaScript is technically required
3. Request approval from @litlfred in your PR or issue
4. Add a code comment explaining the exception

**When writing TypeScript code:**
1. Export all types and interfaces for JSON Schema generation
2. Add JSDoc comments with `@example` tags for documentation
3. Run `npm run generate-schemas` after modifying types
4. Use `RuntimeValidationService` for data validation
5. Document API methods with OpenAPI JSDoc annotations
6. Include request/response examples in documentation

See [TYPESCRIPT_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](TYPESCRIPT_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) for the complete migration plan and approval process.
