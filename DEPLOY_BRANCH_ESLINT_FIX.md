# Deploy Branch ESLint Fix

## Problem
The deploy branch was failing to build with the following ESLint error when `CI=true`:

```
[eslint] 
src/components/BranchListing.js
  Line 354:9:  'loadCommentsForPRs' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars
```

This prevented the landing page deployment workflow from completing successfully.

## Root Cause Analysis
The deploy branch contains a more comprehensive version of BranchListing.js that includes both branch and PR functionality (vs the f2a4d76 commit which is PR-only). However, during development/refactoring, some unused code was left behind:

1. `loadCommentsForPRs` function (line 354) - declared but never called
2. `fetchPRComments` function (line 218) - only used by the unused `loadCommentsForPRs`
3. `setLoadingComments` state variable (line 32) - only used by the unused `loadCommentsForPRs`
4. Broken loading UI that referenced `loadingComments` but the state was never actually set

## Solution Applied
Removed the unused code while preserving all functional comment features:

### Removed (Unused/Broken):
- `loadCommentsForPRs` function - never called anywhere
- `fetchPRComments` function - only referenced by unused `loadCommentsForPRs`
- `loadingComments` state and `setLoadingComments` - only set by unused function
- Broken loading UI that showed "Loading full discussion..." but never triggered

### Preserved (Functional):
- ✅ `fetchAllPRComments` - loads full comments when expanding discussions
- ✅ `loadDiscussionSummaries` - loads comment summaries for PR cards  
- ✅ `toggleDiscussion` - handles expand/collapse of comment sections
- ✅ All comment display, posting, and interaction functionality

## Verification
- Build now passes: `CI=true npm run build` completes successfully
- No functionality lost: All comment features work as before
- Clean code: Removed 55 lines of unused/broken code, added 4 lines of spacing

## Fix Applied to Deploy Branch
Commit: `e87a15c` - "Fix ESLint errors in deploy branch: remove unused loadCommentsForPRs function"

## How to Apply This Fix
If you need to apply this fix manually:

1. Remove the `loadCommentsForPRs` function (lines 354-366)
2. Remove the `fetchPRComments` function (lines 218-252) 
3. Remove `setLoadingComments` from the useState declaration (line 32)
4. Update the comments loading UI to remove the broken loading state check

The exact changes are documented in commit `e87a15c` on the deploy branch.
